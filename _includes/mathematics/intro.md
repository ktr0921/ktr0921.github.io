Humans have invented and developed languages to symbolize entities, constructing *Matrix* that captures the essence of reality. On the other hand, any form of entities can be modelled as *number*, from natural to complex numbers and from points to objects, which existed long before human civilization. Thereby, the universe itself is inherently number, or in short, *all is number*.

**Mathematics** is the study of numbers, so if an entity exists, there exists mathematics to describe it, even if we cannot perceive. This is why we (arguably) refer mathematics as *discovery* instead of *invention* and often considered the most fundamental and precise way of describing reality. Mathematics is a vast, diverse and abstract field such that it requires books of worth. Here, a few branches of mathematics are focused on.
