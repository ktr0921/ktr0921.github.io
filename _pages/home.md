This blog aims to offer comprehensive tutorials on the theories of machine learning, with the primary goal of assisting students in enhancing their understanding of this complex subject. The motivation behind this initiative stems from my own experience, wherein I encountered significant difficulties while pursuing machine learning due to my limited mathematical background. As such, I aspire to share my knowledge and insights to help fellow students avoid such challenges and reach their full potential in this field.
