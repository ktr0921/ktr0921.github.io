I am a soldier specializing in military science and technology (MS&T) research, serving within the Republic of Korea armed forces. Presently, I am actively participating in various projects situated at the Army Consolidated Supply Depot, a central hub for military supply operations. 

Before this assignment, I pursued a Ph.D. candidacy in machine learning at Monash University. My primary interest lies in advancing the development of machines that more closely emulate human intelligence, which I firmly believe will propel us towards a future where machines can attain, and potentially exceed, human cognitive capabilities. My doctoral research focused on the intersection of natural language processing and reinforcement learning, involving the creation of natural language-driven goal-oriented agents.
