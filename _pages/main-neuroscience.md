# The Basics of Neuroscience

The basics of neuroscience begins with how the nervous system is constructed with the biological units.

## Biomedical Science

**Biomedical science** is a broad field that deals with human health and disease using many different disciplines, including biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering. Neuroscience is considered a subfield of biomedical science, which specifically concerns with the study of the human brain and nervous system. Given that knowledge map in neuroscience aligns with biomedical science, this section provides an introduction to some fundamental aspects of biomedical science.

Before getting into the actual contents, in order not to get confused with medical science, here is the difference between the term medical science and biomedical science.
- Medical Science: The practical application of scientific knowledge to patient care.
- Biomedical Science: The scientific investigation of the underlying mechanisms of human health and disease.

So, medical science regards on *doctor* position while biomedical science is more closely related to *researcher* position.

The basics of biomedical science begins with the biological units. An organism has levels of organization that build on each other, from the smallest to the largest, **Cell &#8594; Tissue &#8594; Organ &#8594; Organ System**.
- A **cell** is the smallest biological unit of an organism.
- A **tissue** is a group of cells that work together to perform specific functions.
- An **organ** is a group of tissues that work together to perform specific functions.
- An **organ system** is a group of organs that work together to perform specific functions.

A single organ or organ system is composed of many different types of cells and tissues, so in biomedical science, every biological unit is often studied all together.

Biomedical science can also be viewed from two key concepts:
- **Structure** refers to the physical form or arrangement of an organism or its parts.
    - **Anatomy** is the study of the presence of the structure of organisms.
    - **Morphology** is the study of the relationships between the structures of organisms.
- **Function** refers to the purpose or role of a structure or system within an organism.
    - **Biochemistry** is the study of the chemical processes that occur within organisms.
    - **Physiology** is the study of the normal functions at both the cellular and organism levels.
